# Story blog
Goal is to keep track of various sections of my writing and link them together for quick preview.


## Format
- File names in the format "yyyy-mm-dd-storyname-optionalnumber-title.md" (stored in _posts)
- 
## TODO
- Rewrite previous work into markdown format with relevant links for elements.
- Add onHover display (like wikipedia) to show top content of a link's body
-
