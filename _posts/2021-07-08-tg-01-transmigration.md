# Chapter 00 : Prologue

Jack Li stood in a practice field surrounded by a huge crowd. It was his turn to test as a Spirit Warrior. The shouts of 'Long live Young Master' and "Glory to the Xiao clan" could be heard all around him, only to be drowned by the ruckus of numerous other voices. 

This was the coming of age ceremony held every two years in the Bai Lao city. As an important trade hub, Bai Lao city was a rich city with plenty of resources and powerful clans. Every two years, officials of the city would gather promising youth and have them be tested for various talents. Spirit Warriors were the most coveted, for they could commune with nature and use its power as their own. They could fight better than Enragers and Knights, and protect themselves and their allies from magical artifacts and enemy beasts, even dragons. Bai Lao city only found 1-2 Spirit Warrior talents each time, and their was stiff competition for the role, with children being trained in academies from womb. Jack Li too had trained since birth. In a way, that is.

Jack Li had transmigrated to this world only last week, in the body of Xiao Jining, the third son of Xiao clan's vice-clanmaster. He had been a promising individual, who had obviously been poisoned only a week before the testing. Jack Li had went to sleep in his high-rise apartment on earth that day, only to wake up in the body of this young master. By the time he woke up, there was no trace of poison left in the body. Instead, he could only rely on the memory of his predecessor, the original Jining, whose last thought was panic over being poisoned and over the safety of his parents and his younger sister. What a good guy.

Unexpectedly, Jack Li picked up the role quite fluently. He had dreamed of being transmigrated to a fantasy world, of being a swordmaster, or a bodhisattva, or a ghost or blood cultivator. Anything. Anything was better than his boring high school life. Even his friends had looked down on him recently. So, when he finally got a chance to transmigrate, he had prepared himself to give his all.

Alas, Jack Li's happiness last for a short period of time. The next morning, when he went to the field, his instructor looked at him and hurriedly came over to inspect him. The poison had destroyed the body of this young master. Jack had been feeling pretty powerful the night before. He even finished his favorite Radio Callisthenics routine no. 5 before trying to fall asleep. It turned out, he was actually sub-par now.

When his instructor asked him about it though, he could only say he felt fine. He wasn't even pretending. Then the instructor told him that he had been poisoned somehow, that his trained body had been destroyed. It was possible he may not be able to do anything at all. Jack Li was full in his role. He cursed the heavens, bringing out the very few choice words that Xiao Jining had known. Jack was pretty pissed too. He had been ready for glory. Instead, he was given an underdog arc. How was this fair? He had been the last of his friends to transmigrate, and he still had to go through a bullshit setup where he had to start from 0. 

He cried and wailed over his broken dreams. The instructor looked stricken too, and asked him if he felt something happening to him. This kind of poison cannot act without the person finding out. Jack Li pretended to not know. He spouted some bullshit about having a weird dream. That was his go to story anyway, in case anyone noticed something weird about him. But his explanation only made the instructor more thoughtful and silent. They went to meet with his father, where he was told not to disclose his condition to anyone else.

Over the week, they secretly visited the clan physician who purged the remaining poison from him. He was surprised that the boy has survived at all. He was told he could train if he wanted but his natural advantage and years of practice was gone. His body had been made anew. The poison would be a boon to someone with broken limbs, but for Xiao Jining, it was a curse as his muscles dissolved and his bone marrow shrunk under the external force. The pain is unbearable - the physician said, while studying Jining. Jack Li just said he thought it was a spasm. The physician, his father, and the instructor, all looked rather worried with this. At last, he was told to take body strengthening pills and wait for two years before appearing in the next selection.

This put Jack on familiar ground. A script without challenges was a no script at all. He spouted bullshit about 'for honor', 'for the sake of the clan', 'not letting whoever did this win', etc, and convinced his father to allow him to participate. That was two days ago, and he was waiting for his miracle to happen. He even when to the clan treasury to search for any old necklaces or speaking swords. 

Now, Jack Li aka Xiao Jining stood in the testing ground, cursing his fucking luck. There were a total of 10 spirit stones, each with queue and a testing official standing next to it. The children walked to the stone, put their hands on top of it and the stone released multi-colored lights which the tested then interpreted and announced the results. 

At the beginning, the head official had announced what the colors signified, and asked tested to pay attention to their own colors in case the testing official missed anything. "The base color represents your affinity," he said, "while the color of pattern within represented the second element. The clearer the two colors, the better the body's affinity to learn. A few people will have a pattern within the pattern. And the rarest with have 4 nested patterns with perfect clarity, and the shape itself will be intricate and bright. Those would be the Spirit Warriors candidates and would be invited by the representatives of various schools who were also observing the tests."

As Jining went up to the stone, he still had hope of a miracle. After all, the coolest things happen in front of crowds anyway. As he placed his hand on the stone, he closed his eyes. Then he heard a voice.

"What are you doing?" the voice said. When Jining opened his eyes. He saw the testing official glaring at him. "Press your palm in and release your energy." The testing official's lips twitched as he saw the clan symbol on the boy's clothes, then added, "Don't be nervous, young master."

Jining tried again, this time trying to scour through memories of the dead person. He finally found out how to do it. It was like farting by choice. Not easy to do, but not hard once your body learns how to do it. So he did. He expelled the energy from his body.


The stone glowed bright red. Jining stared at the light but no other colors emerged. Then, as he was about to remove his hand, he saw black dots like flakes of ash dot his vision among the field of fiery red. He looked expectantly at the official who wasn't paying attention, instead writing something down. The official looked up and annouced, pure fire type. No specialty.

Jining knew from earlier what pure fire types looked like. It was very common for Xiao clan to have fire types. But the black flakes were new. He internally debated whether he should tell the official. Then, he just shouted out, "It wasn't pure fire type. Please take another look. There were stars within the color."

The official was surprised. It wasn't unusual for an official to miss subtle patterns. After all, they had to repeatedly pay attention without break. Sometimes patterns appeared when they weren't looking. Nodding his head, he asked Jining to go again.

This time, the black dots or flakes or stars, whatever they could be called, appeared faster and more numerous. Jack Li was so excited, he pushed out more energy, feeling a little dizzy. The official signaled him to stop. He announced, "Impure fire type. Unfit for cultivation. Next!"

Jack Li was flabbergasted. Such a bullshit luck. He turned back to look at this father and instructor who were both shaking their heads. He walked back in a daze. "Unfit for cultivation" kept ringing in his head. His father clasped his hand when they met and bent down to tell him, "Dumb ass, why did you have to point that out." He looked up to see a slightly disappointed face, burdened by everything life threw at the man. Jack Li felt his dreams shattering. 

Back on earth, he and his friends had held so many rituals, whatever they could find, to get themselves to transmigrate. Then, after a few weeks, it started happening. Chang Bin was gone for a week, then he came back with the face of a movie star and told them how he had lived a life as a hero in an ancient kingdom, protecting the city from beasts and rising to be their King. He had the attitude to go with it so Jack Li chose to believe him. Then, Johnny Bao vanished over the summer vacation and came back looking like Hulk. He described his journey as a Warrior who shook the heavens with his body-refining techniques. He told them he had could enlarge himself into a giant 100 leagues tall in that world. Even after coming back, some effects remained on his spirit. He told them of the pain he felt the first night after coming back as his body sucked in the energy from the world and his muscles grew. Next day, dumb Bao Han also showed up with glasses on his face, reciting poems and making witty remarks. He too described how he had been to a new world as a scholar in the king's court and saved the kingdom from rebels. He told of the countless beauties who threw themselves in his arms. 

Listening to all this, Jack Li had wanted nothing more than becoming some sort of cultivator. Going back, he would be able to train himself into a Superman. How awesome would that be. Instead, one week into his trip, he was told - "Fuck you. No cultivation for you." How could he swallow this?

At the time, his instructor came over and told him, "I have seen your energy. You had atleast two pure elements. It seems the poison also polluted the earth element in your Dantian. Alas, no academy will take you after the test official's announcement. You should have waited for two years."

Jack Li, now Xiao Jining, was desperate as he begged, "Is there no other way teacher?"

"There is indeed a path. We'll have to go to Calendria for that. The Dragon Rider tests will be held in a month. Only someone who as been through mortal danger, someone with an iron will, and the acceptance of a dragon would be accepted. You of old were not suitable but you may succeed now. Do you really want to do it though? Dragon riders last only as long as they keep their edge. Riders with more than 5 years of experience can be counted on my two hands."

Jining's eyes lit up. Of course he would go. Fuck Spirit Warriors. Who needed cultivation if he could just ride dragons. He was dancing with joy in his heart as he said outwardly, "Of course I would go teacher. I must bring honor to my father and my clan."

Notes:
MC thinks he would be an awesome transmigrator. But he finds a leisurely life instead. Low hassle. There are times where he plans to meet great heros and kings and such, but he is secretly glad when his request is denied or they tell him to come later.

What he becomes famous for - profound sayings that he memorized during middle school ethics classes, a refreshingly modern view that seems ecentric but also pulls people in, and a system that gives him weird tasks while promising great things in the future when the system is leveled up. Later, the system turns out to be a soul residing in his head that was just projecting back his thoughts in the real world. It literally showed him points that he expected to see, or an interface exactly as he pictured it.
