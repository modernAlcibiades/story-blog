# Chapter 00 : Prologue

Chen Xu, a talented youth of 13, stood alone in the Chen clan's training field. The sun had set a couple hours ago and even the most tenacious of the practitioners from the clan had left for the day, except Chen Xu. He stood panting on the obstacle course, surrounded by wooden puppets and practice mechanisms. For a moment, Chen Xu turned his head up to catch his breath, staring at the shimmering stars. Then, his slim figure, bathed in the gentle blue light of the second moon, trudged slowly and steadily to his home.

In all of the Blue Maple city of the upper Mt Revenant, he was known as the brightest gem of the generation of body trainers, and so he was expected to outshine the others. He could have lived comfortably. As the youngest son of two renowned doctors of the Chen clan, he was doted upon by his parents, almost as much as his younger sister Chen XiaoXiao. His father, Chen Fanfeng, treated ailments of the mortal body while his mother, Chen Xiaobai, treated the sequolae of the heart. They were well respected, even in the larger cities in the middle mountain, and his elder brother, Chen Zhao, had followed his parents' footsteps to practice medicine in the Verdant Clover city, the hegemon on this face of the mountain. 

Chen Xu too could have joined the family profession. Instead, he chose to be a martial practitioner. He was small of stature and of a slim build, not naturally endowed with a heavy musculature common in body practitioners. Yet, he reached the third realm of body strengthening already by the age of 12. In comparison, the normal guards on the outer city walls were only in the first realm. 

As he walked, Chen Xu exited the training area and entered the shopping district. These clan training fields were also open to outsiders so one of the exits connected to the Chen clan's territory in the downtown. His family owned a pharmacy and an infirmary in the area and that is where he was headed. As medical practitioners, having their practice near the training facilities meant good business. Everyday after the practice, he would head to the infirmary and cultivate in the herb bath prepared for him.

Like everyday, he dropped into the pool and lay there listlessly. Contrary to the appearance, he was focusing his mind and practicing his soul perception. A regular body practitioner could only focus on their physique and spent time sleeping during such baths. Chen Xu, though, was cultivating the power of the soul. This was another form of cultivation, one favored by medical practitioners, alchemists, array masters, and beast tamers. Only his mother knew he was training his soul too, and she approved of it, unlike his obstinate physical training which made her worried.

By the time he finished the bath, it was close to midnight. He ate the meal prepared for him and went to sleep in one the beds at the infirmary. He used to live in the clan housing upto last month, but to save the traveling time, as well as avoiding a lot of formalities, he chose to stay in the family shop. He could stay in the shop, use whatever herbs he needed, and condition himself for the upcoming annual Awakening Ceremony.

With that in mind, he went to sleep. Into a very deep, long-lasting slumber.

Enter the migrator - Xu Chen.

Xu Chen was a middle-schooler on earth. He and his 3 friends read a lot of online novels when they should have studied. They would also loudly discuss and enact various scenes. Hence, Xu Chen and his friends were despised by their classmates for their immature antiques. As they grew up, they also visited quakes and shamans and pawnshops to find any possible object or rituals that could make them transmigrate. 

When he was 13, Xu Chen's friends changed one by one. First one became smart over night. He started scoring full marks in tests. Then suddenly the next, the only girl in the group, became pretty as a flower all of a sudden. The two claimed to have visited strange worlds and lived for a long time telling farfetched tales but would not elaborate much, maintaining a mysterious air. Instead, they started interacting with their other classmates, slowly losing touch breaking the group apart.

The remaining two, Xu Chen and Tang Bao, were both excited and scared. Xu Chen waited and waited for his turn. The school term got over, and the summer vacations passed. Still, Xu Chen saw no change. At the end of the summer vacations, Tang Bao too came back changed. He had become tall and muscular instead of the ball of lard he used to be. Unlike the others, Tang Bao didn't ditch Xu Chen, but he didn't tell him the secret either. He just made weird references to the power of solitary cultivation.

Xu Chen was so pissed and depressed that he started skipping classes and would talk to no one. Instead, he would spend hours in the library or the internet, trying to find antique potions and artifacts and such. 

Two weeks after the summer vacations, Xu Chen's class went on a trip to the countryside for three days and two nights. That day too, Xu Chen wandered away from his schoolmates after the trip to the local museum about the archaelogical remains found nearby. At a shabby antique shop outside, he bought a cursed bronze coin that the shopkeeper claimed to be from the Qin dynasty. Apparently the coin's owner would die, but some would come back to life with mysterious abilities. The shopkeeper appeared to be unwilling to sell it, talking about responsibility and all, so Xu Chen begged for the coin even more, eventually spending all his pocket money on the coin and a booklet detailing various ancient rituals.

 As mentioned in the booklet, Xu Chen bought a pound of ox blood and waited for the night. Then, he went to the backyard of the farmhouse their class stayed at, and went to the pig sty. After sinking the bronze coin into the bucket of oxblood, he smearing pig shit all over himself in the patterns the booklet suggested. Then, he took 8 steps in a circle, reciting one bagua with each step.
 
 Nothing happened. The night was quiet with almost no wind and annoyingly humid too. Xu Chen just waited. After some time, he sat down on the ground, then lied down. Soon, he fell asleep.

That is how he found the transmigrator Xu Chen found himself in the body of Chen Xu.
